This React App takes in users performance on simple mental exercises and gives feedback to the user on how that performance relates to the users self-ratings on "Mood" "Sleep" "Exercise" and "Hunger". 

## Deployment 

This application can be found [here.]()

## User Experience

After the page loads a header, scoreboard, and image grid are displayed.

The image grid is shuffled on every page load and image click regardless of choice.
Clicking one of the images starts the game and adds +1 to your score.

This counter helps the user keep track of images left to click
If all images are clicked successfully. A message telling the user so pops up and the game starts over.

If an incorrect choice is made a shaking animation is run on the image grid and a game over message is displayed asking the user to try again.

The highest score for the user's session is also displayed on the scoreboard.
